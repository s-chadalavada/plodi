# PLODI - Pandemic Loan Outlier Detection and Indicators

This is a project that was completed in Fall 2023 as part of the UC Berkeley MIDS W210 Session 9 Capstone. The team consists of UC Berkeley MIDS students.

## Background and Goal
To support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Small Business Administration disbursed $1.2T of loans. Due to the rapid pace at which loans were processed, estimates of fraudulent loans range from $100B-$200B.

Our project goal was to Identify key fraud risk factors, using machine learning models, and develop a web dashboard that will allow users to review ranking results and explore loan features from our risk assessment analysis. 

This can guide further development for identification of fraud indicators and investigation priority for regulatory agencies, guidance for loan screening for future loan programs, and supports open access to government spending for journalists and interested public individuals
